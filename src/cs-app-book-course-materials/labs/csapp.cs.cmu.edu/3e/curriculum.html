<h1>Role of CS:APP in the CMU CS/ECE Systems Curriculum</h1>
<p>
The area of <i>computer systems</i> spans a community of faculty in
both Computer Science (CS) and Electrical and Computer Engineering
(ECE) departments. While most of us in the systems community are
convinced that students need an early introduction to the core ideas
in computer systems, there is still some debate about where this
introductory core systems course should fit in the CS and ECE
curriculums. Here is how we have resolved this issue at Carnegie
Mellon. Perhaps it will be a useful model for other schools.

<p>
At Carnegie Mellon, CS and ECE are in separate schools, with CS in the
School of Computer Science and ECE in the Engineering School. The two
departments jointly offer the following core sophomore-level
introductory systems course, based on the CS:APP text, for students
in <i><b>both</b></i> departments:


<blockquote>
<b>15-213/18-213</b>
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213">
Introduction to Computer Systems</a>.  Fall, Spring, and Summer: 12 units.
 This
course provides a programmer's view of how computer systems execute
programs, store information, and communicate. It enables students to
become more effective programmers, especially in dealing with issues
of performance, portability and robustness. It also serves as a
foundation for courses on compilers, networks, operating systems, and
computer architecture, where a deeper understanding of systems-level
issues is required. Topics covered include: machine-level code and its
generation by optimizing compilers, performance evaluation and
optimization, computer arithmetic, memory organization and management,
networking technology and protocols, and supporting concurrent
computation.  Prerequisite: 15-122 (Principles of Imperative
Programming), where students learn C)

</blockquote>


15-213 (also cross-listed as 18-213, 15-513, and 18-600) is the course we refer
to as <a href="http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/courses.html">ICS+</a> in
the
<a href="http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/preface3e.pdf">CS:APP
Preface</a>. Over 1200 undergraduate and graduate students in CS, ECE,
and other departments on campus take 15-213 each year.  The 15-213
course serves several different purposes in our curriculum:

<ul>
<li> 
<p>
For humanities, liberal arts, and non-CE 
(Computer Engineering) students in the engineering
school, it is often the terminal course in their systems education.</p>

<li> For CS and CE students, it serves as the foundational
prerequisite for
upper level systems courses offered in both the CS and ECE
departments, including networks (CS), compilers (CS), secure programming (CS), databases (CS),
operating systems (CS), embedded systems (ECE), 
computer and network security (ECE), advanced digital design (ECE), wireless sensor networks (ECE),
distributed systems
(CS), computer architecture (ECE), and parallel computer architecture
(CS).  

<p>
Establishing 15-213 as a prerequisite for the upper level systems
courses helps those instructors offer better courses because they can
make assumptions about the general systems maturity of their
students. For example, instructors in the ECE computer architecture
course can now assume that students know how assembly language,
caches, and virtual memory work, and thus they can focus right away on
the more interesting and appropriate design issues such as ISA design,
cache design, and TLB design.</p>

<li> 
<p>For our CS and ECE MS students, many of whom have little or no
understanding of computer systems when they arrive on campus, it helps them succeed in our
systems courses. In fact, we require all MS students across campus to
take some version of the ICS course before they can enroll in any
systems classes at CMU.</p>

<li> 
<p>It provides our students with experience in programming C.  This
is important because many of the upper level CS and CE systems courses require
knowledge of C, but the CS intro courses are all based on Java or Python.</p>

<li>
<p>
It provides a strong foundation in data representations.  Courses
in computer graphics (CS) and computational photography (CS) have made
15-213 a prerequisite, since they want students to understand
floating-point representations and their limitations.</p>
